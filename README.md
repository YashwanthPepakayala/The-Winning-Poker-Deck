THE WINNING POKER DECK 🃏🤵
Welcome to Poker Winner Evaluator, a Python-based application that accurately evaluates Poker hands, ranks them, and resolves ties with intelligent logic. Whether you're a developer showcasing technical expertise or a recruiter looking for a project that highlights data structures, algorithms, and Python skills, this project is designed to impress.

🚀 Key Features
Comprehensive Hand Evaluation: Supports all standard Poker hands like Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, and more. It evaluates hands using the official Poker hand ranking system.
Advanced Tie-Breaking Logic: Handles tie situations using a sophisticated tiebreak algorithm that compares hands based on card ranks, ensuring a fair winner.
Optimized for Performance: Designed to handle multi-player games efficiently with quick evaluations and minimal computational overhead.
Modular and Scalable Code: Easily adaptable to accommodate any number of players, and supports custom hands for a dynamic gaming experience.
Clean and Well-Documented: A highly readable and modular codebase with extensive comments and documentation, making it easy for other developers to understand and contribute.

🎯 Why Use This Project?
This project is more than just a Poker game — it’s a showcase of high-level programming skills. Here's why this project is perfect for developers, recruiters, and anyone passionate about game development:

Solid Foundation in Algorithms & Data Structures: The project demonstrates practical application of sorting, ranking, and data handling using Python's built-in libraries like collections.Counter.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: The use of classes and methods makes the code clean, maintainable, and scalable for future improvements.
Real-World Application: Perfect for technical interviews or as a foundation for building more complex card games or simulations.
Boosts Coding Competence: Learn and demonstrate your understanding of game theory, hand ranking logic, and tie-breaking algorithms.

🧑‍💻 How It Works
This Python program takes players' cards, evaluates their hands based on Poker rules, and determines the winner using advanced tie-breaking logic.

Input Player Cards: Each player’s cards are inputted as a list of strings representing the cards.
Evaluate Hand Rankings: The program checks for each possible hand (e.g., Royal Flush, Full House) using the built-in methods.
Tie-Breaking Logic: If players have the same hand, the tiebreak algorithm compares the card values to find the highest-ranked hand.
Return the Winner: The player with the highest-ranked hand is declared the winner, or a tie is resolved by comparing card values.

🏆 What You Will Learn
Poker Game Logic: Gain an in-depth understanding of how poker hands are ranked and how to implement game rules programmatically.
Efficient Data Handling: Work with dictionaries, lists, and collections to manage player data and hand evaluations.
Algorithm Optimization: Learn how to efficiently compare large sets of data, optimize for speed, and ensure accuracy.
Real-World Python Skills: Build confidence in applying Python’s advanced features like sorting algorithms, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.
